# Fast-check lab
In this lab you'll use Fast-check to test some crappy implementations of a sorting algorithm.

Start by writing tests for `reverse`, then test `sort`. 

## Reverse
In the `reverse` folder you'll find two files:
* `reverse.js` - Do NOT look in this file. It contains one working reversing function (`reverse`), and one which has some flaws (`crappyReverse`). 
* `reverse.test.js` - Here is where you'll write your tests.

## Sort
In the `sort` folder you'll find two files:
* `sort.js` - Do NOT look in this file. It contains one working sorting function (`sort`), and one which has some flaws (`crappySort`). 
* `sort.test.js` - Here is where you'll write your tests.

## Running tests
Run tests once using `yarn test` or on watch mode using `yarn test:watch`.

# Examples from slides
If you've forgotten the syntax, it might help to look in `examples-from-slides/add.test.js`.
